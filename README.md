# Discord_Ping_Bot
Simple discord ping bot to annoy friends

I do not take any responsibility for damages you may cause through the use of this bot!
This bot is/was purely for me to learn how to code discord.py and was not intended for any nefarious purposes.

~~You can currently only ping one person at a time!
issuing any more then one ping command breaks the bot and you will be unable to stop it from pinging!
(currently fixing)~~ **FIXED**

# 2024 Update

Recoded entire bot in discord.py and fixed the multiple ping command bug

### How to use
follow install guide on the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html) website <br>
essentially run ``pip install -U discord.py`` if you are using a virtual environment (which is good practice)
